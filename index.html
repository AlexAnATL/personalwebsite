          <p><em><strong>
          As a graduate from Georgia State University, programming has motivated me to take on new
          milestones in creating software with an object-oriented thought process. With the experience I
          have so far, my skills include coding intricate software and user interfaces in Java and Swift,
          debugging and finding hidden logic errors within the code, and analyzing the code in order to find
          minor improvements to create fluidity.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          My motive as a programmer is to develop and code applications that will help create sustainability for our future generations while mitigating the damages that has already been done.</em></strong></p>
